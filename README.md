# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
To ensure that you meet client Expectations 
For Budgeting purposes such as the resources and costs for a certain project.
To boost the teams morale
Increase efficiency
How Project Managers Can Ensure Deadlines Are Met
Ensure that you have Clear Project Planning
Breaking tasks into small bits that are manageable 
Set Realistic Timelines.
Use Project Management Tools 
Prioritize the most important Tasks 
Identify potential risks at the early stages.
and have mitigation strategies in place.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Ensures that the project goals can be achieved-checks on its viability.
Maximizes and ensures effective resource control.
Ensure that the client needs are met.
Mitigates the risk at an early stage.
ensures that the project deadlines are met.

Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns
having Accurate Initial Cost Estimation
Have Smart goals-that is specific leasurable adaptable 
Implement projrct management software to measure budget performance.
Monitor team productivity
Identify any potential risks at the initial stages.
Use technology for automation to minimise workload.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile focuses on adaptability and encourages collaboration.
Waterfall on the other end is more structured and follows a prescribed procedure. 
Agile Advantages:
Faster delivery 
Easily adaptable
Improves quality as there uis continuous testing
Since it involves the customer, it ensures that their needs are met.
Agile Disadvantages:
Very unpredictable considering its flexibility.
Needs customer involvement.
Waterfall Ads:
Follows a clear structure.
Is predictable.
 Waterfall Dis:
Is not flexible to changes.
Limited customer feedback during development
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile;
Software Startups such as an application as it is flexible and requires feedback.
development of games- i
Waterfall is More Beneficial
Construction Projects 
Medical Device Software –there is a specific way it ought to look like.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Unit Testing – to discover bugs at an early stage.
Integration Testing –to check on how compatible different modules are.
System Testing – Verifies the entire system meets the intended function.
Ensure that your codes meet the required quality.
Why High Standards Matter
Reduces Costs – if you discover bugs early, you will fix them early as well.
Prevents data breaches and cyber threats.
Protects the reputation of the brand.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Creating clear boundaries limits what to be included in the project.
Setting clear objectives means that we have a trajectory of where we are headed.
Helps in estimating the resources to be used.
mitigates any potential risks.
A well-defined scope includes:
Project goals
Deliverables
Key milestones
Constraints and assumptions
Inclusions and exclusions

What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Why is it Useful?
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a breakdown of a project into smaller, manageable tasks. 
Importance;
Manages large tasks
Clearly assigns responsibilities
Reduces complexity of the work considering it is broken down

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Improves Time Management 
Enhances Resource Allocation 
Increases Accountability 
Supports Risk Mitigation 
How Gantt Charts Assist in Project Scheduling
You can track the progress of a project.
Manages deadline better.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
olves major transportation challenges
Some of the problems are;
lack of enoughh matatus, waiting for matatus too long, overcrowded matatus

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
provides a trajectory of where we are headed
better testing

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Imagine never having to wait endlessly for a ride, worry about unpredictable fares, or struggle with cash payments. Our ride-hailing app connects people to safe, affordable, and reliable transportation at the tap of a button.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Faster Pickups – Our AI-powered system pairs riders with the nearest available driver to reduce wait times.
Ride Preferences – Users can choose quiet rides, preferred drivers, or specific vehicle types.
Enhanced security
Flexible Pricing

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
market size is 20 million -kenya's population. I intend it to begin in cities before penetrating the remote areas.

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
identify competitors
establish what technology to use
adjust the pricing
